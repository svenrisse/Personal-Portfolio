                    Hello! My name is Sven and I'm passionate for creating
                    things on the internet. My journey in Web Development
                    started in 2021 when I started learning the basics of HTML,
                    CSS and JavaScript.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fast-forward to today and I've decided to pursue a career in
                    Fullstack Development and am currently in training at
                    HÃ¤ndlerbund and YAY! Digital.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most of my free time is spent reading science fiction and
                    fantasy novels, cooking and powerlifting when not currently
                    writing code and working on side projects.
